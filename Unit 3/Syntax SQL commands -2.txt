Syntax SQL commands:
1. Alter: The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
	Adding: ALTER TABLE table_name
		ADD column_name datatype;

	DROP:   ALTER TABLE table_name
		DROP COLUMN column_name;
	
	***RENAME: ALTER TABLE table_name
		RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;
	
	CHANGE: ALTER TABLE table_name
		CHANGE column_name column_name datatype(size);

CLAUSE: 

2.DISTINCT: The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values. Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
	
	
	SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name;
	

3. WHERE Clause: The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;

4. OR clause: The OR command is used with WHERE to include rows where either condition is true.

	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column = value1 OR column = value2;

5. IN clause: The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

6. BETWEEN clause: The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates. The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 
 
	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;	

7. GROUP BY: The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country"

	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition
	GROUP BY column_name(s);

8. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;	

9. HAVING clause: The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions. We will see further what aggregate functions are.

	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition
	HAVING condition;
